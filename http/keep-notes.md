Keeping notes is ont of the key aspects of penetration testing. 

Keeping notes in a file named NOTES will allow you to have a file in each pentest directory. It will allow you to do things like:

	$find . -name NOTES -exec grep 'weird bug' {}\;

to find all the pentests with a 'weird bug'. Having notes in a text file allows you to use all your favorite tools and use version control systems. Looking into folding for vim. 

*make a template so you don't have to start from scratch every time*

### Example template

Project's Name
Start date: XX/XX/XXXX
Finish date: XX/XX/XXXX
Network information - handy to know IP address, port info, etc
Info/Credentials - passwords
Todos - ideas you want to explore
Issues - use as much detail as possible

*some shortcut ideas*

[] - new. The issue has not been communicated.
[-] - communicate. The issue hasn't been communicated to the client/project/...
[X] - reported. The issue is in the report
