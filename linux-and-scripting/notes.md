# Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), is the protocol that web clients and web servers use to communicate. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.

HTTP is known as the **request-response** protocol. This means that a client makes an HTTP request to a web server asking for a web resource and the server will return the resource in its HTTP response message.

# Domain Name System (DNS)

DNS is a hierarchial and decentralized naming system for computers, services, o other resources connected to the internet or private network. It is the system for translating websites names into numbers (IP Addresses). Every website and internet connected device has an associated IP address.

# WHOIS

WHOIS is a query and response protocl that is widely used for querying databases that store the registered users or assigness of an internet resource, such as a domain name, an IP address block or autonomous system, but is also used for a wider range of information.

# Network socket

A network socket is an internet endpoint which allows a user to connect to a server (i.e. a remote computer). Both web clients and web servers each have a socket, IP address, and port number. The server will have a consistent port number, whilst the client is assigned a randomly generated number (known as an ephemeral port), typically between 1024 and 65535.

Generally, a "socket" refers to a socket in an Internet Protocol (IP) network. HTTP requests and responses are built on sockets.

# Scoping a pentest

Scoping is on of the most important parts of penetration testing enagement as it will determine if you will be able to do a good job:

* Not enough time: you will struggle to finish in time, and you will miss things or provide an incomplete report
* Too much time: the client is not going to buy your services (and you are likely to fall into the "not enough time: category for the next job if you need money)

The best way to scope an application is to perform a lot of testng and know how much time you spent on them and if it was enough or not.
