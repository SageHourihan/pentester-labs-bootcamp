# Virtual Hosting

Virtual hosting is a method for hosting multiple domain names (with separate handling of each name) on a single server. This makes it possible to have `www.example.com` and `www.example2.com` running on a single machine.

There are three types of virtual hosting: **IP-based virtual hosting, name-based virtual hosting,** and **port-based virtual hsoting.**

### IP-based 

With IP-based virtual hosting, each website on  a single server has a **unique IP addres**

An example configuration of virtual IP-based hosts on an Apache server is outlined below.

	<VirtualHost 172.20.30.40:80>
	 ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com
	 DocumentRoot "/www/vhosts/example/"
	 ServerName"www.example.com"
	</VirtualHost>

	<VirtualHost 172.20.30.50:80>
  	 ServerAdmin webmaster@example2.com
  	 DocumentRoot "/www/vhosts/example2/"
  	 ServerName "www.example2.com"
	</VirtualHost>

### Name-based

With name-based virtual hosting, a single IP address may have several host names. For example, a server could be receiving requests for two domains `www.mysite.com` and `www.mysite2.com`, both of which resolve to the same IP address 

### Port-based

Port-based virtual hosting involves explicitly binding each website to a unique port number and IP address.
